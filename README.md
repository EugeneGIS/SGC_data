# SGCdata

Facing the big demands from the students, the Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC) decided to invent and maintain some programming courses. Thus, as one of the popular programming languages for data analysis, R programming will be introduced to the students. This is the reason why Marj point out the 'Advanced geospatial data analysis' course.

Meanwhile, benefiting from the convenience of storing the dataset, the 'SGCdata' package will be published and spread soon for the R users and course followers. We hope everyone can enjoy it.

The main objective of this package is to store the datasets for the Course 'Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis' in SGC, UNIL.
